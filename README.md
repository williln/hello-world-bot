# meatloaf-bot
A Twitter bot that tweets lyric's from Meat Loaf's "Bat Out of Hell" one line at a time from [@meatloafbot](https://twitter.com/meatloafbot).

This is a forked from the Build-a-Bot workshop at PyDX Conf 2015 in Portland, OR.

You'll need to add a text file to book.txt and a secrets.py file that contains a consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_key, and access_secret for authorization with Twitter.

Detailed setup instructions are at https://tpinecone.gitbooks.io/build-a-bot-workshop/content/
